# MeshTenna
An app for comparing the performance of different antennas and locations using Meshtastic devices. It measures signal strength (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to help identify the best antenna and optimal locations for specific conditions. Connects to a portable test node and uses a fixed destination node for consistent measurements.
